# Runedoku Helper
A Runelite plugin to provide hints and utilities to help solve Runedoku puzzles.

## Features
* Show the solution to the puzzle. Highlight solution cells for currently selected rune, and darkened image of all
  cell solutions
* Overlay numbers instead of runes - makes it easier to proceed methodically, as well as easier to use an external 
  sudoku solver
* Pencil markings - mark the currently selected rune as a possibility with the right-click menu or shift-click.
  (Only displays as a number - recommended to use with the number overlay)
* Highlights clashing entries - mistakes are easier to find with an error border around clashing entries
* Configurable - all colors and features are fully configurable in the plugin's config panel
